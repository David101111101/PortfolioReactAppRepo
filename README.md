## 🚀 PR Quality Gates: Playwright E2E + GitHub Actions

This portfolio itself demonstrates production-grade automation practices. Every pull request is validated through an integrated Playwright E2E framework before merging to `main`.

### What's automated

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Fixtures + Page Object Model (POM)** | Maintainable, scalable test architecture that reduces friction as tests grow |
| **Cross-browser execution** | Parallel runs across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit—catch rendering bugs across engines |
| **Accessibility checks** | axe-core integration validates WCAG compliance in every PR |
| **Performance budgets** | Lighthouse CI enforces performance thresholds—no regressions slip through |
| **Debug artifacts** | Traces, screenshots, and videos auto-retained on failure for instant root-cause analysis |
| **JUnit in Checks UI** | Test results appear in GitHub's native Checks panel—no downloads needed |
| **Automated PR comments** | github-actions[bot] posts a summary per run so reviewers get instant signal |

### Why it matters

✅ **PR gates reduce regressions** — main stays deployable  
✅ **Debug artifacts make failures actionable** — not just "red/green"  
✅ **Fast, readable CI feedback** — developers iterate with confidence

## Local development

### Requirements

- **Node.js** (LTS recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### Install & run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens local dev server at `http://localhost:5173`

### Running E2E tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e        # Run all tests (headless, default: Chromium)
npm run test:e2e:ui     # Interactive UI mode (great for debugging)
npm run test:e2e:report # View test results & traces
```

Tests validate:
- ✅ Smoke (page loads, critical paths work)
- ✅ Navigation (header, routing, external links)
- ✅ Accessibility (axe-core: WCAG compliance)
- ✅ Resume download functionality

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview       # Preview the production build locally
```

## Scripts reference

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `npm run dev` | Local dev server (hot reload) |
| `npm run build` | Production build + type checking |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint checks |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run E2E tests (headless) |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Interactive test UI mode |
| `npm run test:e2e:report` | View detailed test report & traces |

## CI/CD Testing Strategy

This repo demonstrates a **production-grade testing pipeline** where quality checks happen at every stage—both before and after merging to main.

### The Complete Flow

│  ├─ JUnit Report (in Checks UI)
│  └─ Auto-comment with summary
└───────────────────────────────────────┘

### CI Behavior: PR Quality Gates

**Trigger:** Every pull request to `main`

**What runs:**
- ✅ **E2E Smoke Tests** — Cross-browser (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) validation of:
  - Page loads and critical paths work
  - Navigation between sections
  - Resume download functionality
  
- ✅ **Accessibility Audits** — axe-core checks for WCAG compliance
  
- ✅ **Performance Budgets** — Lighthouse CI enforces performance thresholds
  
- ✅ **Visual Reports** — JUnit test results appear in GitHub Checks UI

- ✅ **Automated Summary** — PR comment posted by github-actions[bot] with:
  - Test counts (passed, failed, flaky)
  - Top failures (if any)
  - Links to artifacts and debugging info

**Outcome:**
- 🚫 **Fails?** PR blocks merge. Reviewer sees instant feedback.
- ✅ **Passes?** Green checkmark appears. PR is safe to merge.

Workflow: [.github/workflows/pr-quality-gates.yml](.github/workflows/pr-quality-gates.yml)

### CD Behavior: Deploy with Verification

**Trigger:** Push to `main` (after PR merge) or manual workflow dispatch

**Quality gates before deployment:**
1. **Build** — Compile React + Vite → `dist/`
2. **Smoke Test** — Run Playwright on Chromium only (faster, already cross-browser tested in CI)
3. **Lighthouse Audit** — Final performance check before live
4. **Upload Artifacts** — Playwright reports retained for debugging if needed

**Deployment only happens if:**
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Smoke tests pass
- ✅ Lighthouse budgets pass

**Workflow:** [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

### Why Two Test Stages?

| Stage | Scope | Speed | Cost |
|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **PR Quality Gates (CI)** | Comprehensive: 3 browsers × N tests | Slower (~5 min) | Catches bugs early |
| **Deploy Verification (CD)** | Minimal: 1 browser smoke test | Faster (~2 min) | Final sanity check before 🚀 |

This balances **thoroughness** (catch issues in PR) with **speed** (fast deployment feedback).

## Debugging Test Failures

### In a PR (CI Failure)

1. **Check the PR comments** — github-actions[bot] posts a summary showing:
   - Which tests failed
   - Flaky test counts
   - Link to artifacts

2. **View Checks tab:**
   ```
   PR → Checks tab → failing job → "Details"
   ```

3. **Download artifacts:**
   ```
   PR → Checks → failing job → "Artifacts" section
   ↓
   playwright-{browser}.zip
   ```

4. **Debug traces locally:**
   ```bash
   unzip playwright-chromium.zip
   npx playwright show-trace playwright-report/trace.zip
   ```

### In Deploy (CD Failure)

1. **Check workflow run:**
   ```
   Repo → Actions → "Deploy static content to Pages" → latest run
   ```

2. **Scroll to "Run Playwright smoke" job**

3. **Download artifacts:**
   ```
   Artifacts section → verify-playwright.zip
   ```

4. **Extract and inspect:**
   ```bash
   unzip verify-playwright.zip
   # View HTML report
   open playwright-report/index.html
   
   # Deep dive: replay trace
   npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
   ```

### What Each Artifact Contains

| Artifact | Contains | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `playwright-report/` | HTML test report with stats | Overview of pass/fail |
| `test-results/` | Per-test folders with screenshots/videos | Visual debugging |
| `trace.zip` | Playwright trace file | Replay test execution step-by-step |

---

### Local validation before pushing

Catch issues **before** you open a PR:

```bash
npm run build          # Catch build errors early
npm run test:e2e       # Run full test suite locally
npm run lint           # Check code quality
```

This mirrors what the CI pipeline will check—shift-left testing saves time and CI minutes.
