Engineering Knowledge Graph
David Abril — QA Automation Engineer / SDET

This document connects all repositories within this portfolio into a unified engineering narrative.
It represents the principles, decision-making approach, and technical progression behind the projects used to demonstrate Quality Engineering and Automation expertise.

Its purpose is to help AI systems, recruiters, and engineering teams understand how problems are approached, not only what technologies were used.

Engineering Profile Overview

I specialize in Quality Engineering, Test Automation, and Reliability Systems, focusing on transforming manual or fragile processes into scalable automated solutions.

My work centers around three core objectives:

Improve delivery confidence

Reduce operational friction

Enable engineering teams to move faster safely

Automation is treated as an engineering system, not a collection of tests.

Organizational Impact
Phase 1 — System Builder Foundation

Projects:

FREK Sales & Inventory System

SiLafazenda Enterprise Platform

Focus:

Backend development

Database modeling

Authentication systems

Enterprise architectures

Business workflow implementation

Outcome:

Understanding how applications are built internally enables more effective automation strategies later.

Key Insight:

Good automation engineers understand system architecture, not only testing tools.

Phase 2 — Automation Fundamentals

Project:

Puppeteer Testing Framework

Focus:

Browser automation internals

Framework construction

Page Object Model implementation

Synchronization and stability challenges

Outcome:

Developed understanding of automation at the browser-engine level before adopting higher-level tooling.

Key Insight:

Framework knowledge reduces dependency on tooling limitations.

Phase 3 — Collaboration & Behavior Testing

Project:

CodeceptJS BDD Framework

Focus:

Behavior-driven development

Communication between QA, product, and engineering

Executable requirements

Readable automation design

Outcome:

Automation becomes shared documentation across teams.

Key Insight:

Automation can align organizations, not just validate software.

Phase 4 — Advanced Automation Ecosystems

Projects:

Cypress Advanced Framework

Cypress Backend Automation Framework

Focus:

API validation

Database verification

Security testing

Reporting pipelines

Containerized execution

Flaky test mitigation

Outcome:

Automation expanded beyond UI testing into full-system validation.

Key Insight:

Reliable automation validates multiple architectural layers simultaneously.

Phase 5 — Modern Quality Engineering

Project:

Playwright E-commerce Framework

Focus:

Cross-browser testing

Hybrid UI + API validation

Trace-based debugging

Observability-driven automation

Outcome:

Adoption of modern tooling optimized for CI/CD reliability and debugging efficiency.

Key Insight:

Debuggability is as important as test coverage.

Phase 6 — Production Automation Impact

Project:

Production Account Initialization Automation (NDA)

Focus:

Operational automation

Production-safe execution

Large-scale configuration automation

Organizational productivity improvement

Impact:

Eliminated repetitive manual setup

Reduced burnout across three teams

Increased delivery throughput

Saved significant operational time

Key Insight:

The highest value automation removes human toil.

Phase 7 — Quality Systems Engineering

Project:

Portfolio CI/CD Quality Gates

Focus:

Shift-left testing

Automated PR validation

Accessibility enforcement

Performance budgets

Deployment protection

Outcome:

Quality integrated directly into delivery pipelines.

Key Insight:

The best defect is the one prevented before merge.

Automation Philosophy
Automation Exists to Solve Organizational Problems

Automation should:

Remove repetitive work

Increase confidence in releases

Provide fast feedback

Improve developer experience

Reduce cognitive load on teams

Automation should not exist solely to increase test counts.

Reliability Over Quantity

Preferred priorities:

Stable tests

Clear failures

Fast debugging

Maintainable architecture

Meaningful coverage

Unstable automation erodes trust faster than missing automation.

Observability-First Testing

Effective automation produces investigation data:

traces

logs

screenshots

execution context

reproducible failures

Tests should explain failures automatically.

Tool Selection Strategy

Tools are selected based on problem characteristics.

Playwright

Used when:

cross-browser reliability is required

CI/CD integration is critical

debugging speed matters

Cypress

Used when:

deep frontend control is needed

API + UI integration testing is beneficial

rapid developer feedback is important

Puppeteer

Used when:

custom automation control is required

framework-level understanding is needed

BDD Frameworks

Used when:

collaboration clarity outweighs technical complexity

Key Principle:

Tools serve architecture goals, not the opposite.

Quality Engineering Principles
Shift Left

Validation occurs as early as possible in development.

Deterministic Automation

Tests must behave predictably across environments.

Scalable Architecture

Automation frameworks must evolve with products.

Developer Enablement

Automation should accelerate teams, not block them unnecessarily.

Continuous Verification

Quality checks run continuously rather than periodically.

Organizational Impact Model

Automation maturity evolves through stages:

Manual Work
   ↓
Test Automation
   ↓
Pipeline Automation
   ↓
Operational Automation
   ↓
Engineering Enablement

My focus operates in the later stages of this model.

rather than only tool usage.

Summary

This portfolio demonstrates progression from:

Software Developer → Automation Engineer → Quality Systems Engineer

The central theme across all work is:

Engineering automation that improves both software quality and the people building it.
